        <p>The biggest challenge I encountered working with Bootstrap was just getting started.
        After I downloaded the compiled CSS files, I wasn't sure where to go next. I reviewed the
        website, but there was so much information there, it was pretty overwhelming. I Googled
        "Bootstrap for beginners" and found a tutorial from freeCodeCamp, which was very informative
        and gave me some direction to get started on my website project.</p>
        <p>Once I got started on the basic layout of my home page, I noticed that the header for the
        website title was very close to the top edge of the page. I looked at the bootstrap.css file
        and saw that the default was to have 0 margin on the top for H1 headings, which I was using.
        I thought the solution would be easy: to increase the top margin. I tried multiple times to
        increase the top margin, but nothing would work. I experimented on the bottom margin and it
        worked just fine. I was going to let it go, but I decided to try putting inline CSS in the
        HTML document, which is typically not ideal. However, this method worked and the title was no
        longer sitting at the very edge of the screen.</p>
        <p>I was ready to move onto the individual composer pages - or so I thought. I looked closer
        at the model sketch and realized it would not be so simple to have the Works column go all the
        way to the bottom of the page while the Composer Name column only spanned across part of the
        page. I went back the the Grid page on the Bootstrap website to see if they had any information
        on how to get a grid to look similar to what I needed - et voil√†! I found the section on nested
        rows and realized that would work perfectly for my composer page layouts.</p>
        <p>After I loaded all of the content into the composer pages, I was resizing the browser window
        to see how the columns would respond. Everything looked great except one thing: a couple of the
        works had individual words that were too long to fit in the column and ran over into the bio
        section when the browser window was very small. I did some Googling and found the text break
        function which breaks the word when it reaches the edge of the column and continues the rest of
        the word on the following line.</p>
        <p>Overall, I enjoyed working with Bootstrap once I became somewhat familiar with it. There
        are still so many features that I didn't get into, and I would really like to take the time to
        play around with it some more. Many of the examples on the Bootstrap website are much more complex
        than the project required, but I can see how they would be very helpful and time-saving for
        building complicated websites.</p>
